Excuse me?
Pardon me?

How are you?
How are things?
Whatâ€™s up?

Do you come to this restaurant often?
Not too bad.
The same as usual.

You've got to be kidding.
I need to start thinking about my health.
I get sick very often these days.
Smoking and drinking is bad for your health.
You're ruining your health.
You need to take care of yourself more.
Have you lost weight?
You look better, did you lose weight?
Have you been dieting?
Wow. You look so good.

I started to diet so I am watching what I eat.
I want to lose some weight before I take family pictures next month.

You do not need to go on a diet.
You look great now. Why do you want to go on a diet?

It's very comfortable talking to you.
I feel like I can be myself when I'm talking to you.

Does it take you long to style your hair?
I bet you get hit on a lot.
It was so great talking to you.
I would love to get together and chat some more.
Would you care to have dinner with me sometime?

I'm excited to be here.
